The surface area A of a sphere depends on its radius r as follows: A = 4 pi r^2 . Write a script file that prompts the user to enter a radius , computes the surface area , and displays the result.


```
# Get input from user for radius
radius = float(input("Enter the radius: "))

# Compute the surface area
surface_area = 4 * 3.14 * (radius ** 2)

# Display the result
print("The surface area of a sphere with radius", radius, "is", surface_area)
```
